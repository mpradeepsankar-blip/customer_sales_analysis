Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering business insights through interactive dashboards and reports.
It covers data analysis using Python, SQL querying, and data visualization using Power BI, followed by a business presentation (PPT) created using Gamma.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills that are commonly required for Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles.
